Welcome to Dat2Bit!

## Overview

Dat2Bit is a user-friendly tool that allows you to convert image, audio or video files (initially designed for .png files), into a Python (.py) file.
The resulting .py file contains a function with the embedded data.


## How to Use

1. **Select Data File:**
   -	Click the "Select File" button to choose the data file you want to convert.
	This could (in theory) be any audio and / or visual file that python can open with the "rb" argument.

2. **Choose Save Location:**
   -	Click the "Save Location" button to specify where you want to save the resulting .py file.

3. **Create .py File:**
   -	Click on "Create .py" to start the conversion process. The tool will generate a Python file with the embedded data.


## Quick Start

1. Double-click the "Install Dat2Bit.exe" file to install the application
2. Double-click the "Dat2Bit.exe" file to launch the application.
3. Use the "Select File" button to choose your data file.
4. Click "Save Location" to set the destination for the resulting .py file.
5. Press "Create .py" to initiate the conversion process.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or errors, check "debug.log". The app also creates a message window to highlight any errors.
